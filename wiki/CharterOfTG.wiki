  (TDWG TG guidelines: “Core members are not people who may have contributed in the past. This is not a credits list. Members of the group will be identified through the membership. Core members could explain to an outsider the purpose, justification and current activities of the group. Any core member could substitute for the Convener when required.”)

== Motivation ==

  * TDWG has embraced a semantic web approach to data discovery and integration for the last several years. But, as discussion on tdwg-content has demonstrated, there is disagreement over many details of this vision. Further, semantic web usage patterns have evolved over this period, and continue to evolve. Biodiversity data providers, aggregators, and consumers need examples of usage patterns that work in our domain, and that represent current best practice. The group will determine such usage patterns through experimentation, and will provide well documented examples of using RDF to represent biodiversity data, and SPARQL to query that data.

== Goals, Outputs, and Outcomes ==

The RDF/OWL Task Group has the following goals:

  # Develop *use-cases and competency questions* that include tests of data discovery, exchange and semantic reasoning.
  # Experiment with a variety of approaches to addressing the use cases.
  # Develop documentation (guides and working examples) to make it easier for others to participate and contribute.
  # Enable the use of GUIDs (specifically HTTP URI GUIDs?) by developing a consensus on the appropriate *class/rdf:type designations for biodiversity resources* and the basic metadata properties (described using RDF) that should be returned when those GUIDs are resolved.
  #  Develop *recommendations for linkage models* to other domains of biodiversity data (taxonomic complexity, observations, phylogenies, etc), carefully critiquing existing ontologies and indicating where development of new ontologies may be needed.
  # Meet the needs for standardized data exchange by identifying terms from *existing vocabularies and ontologies* that are suitable for use as data properties of biodiversity resources.  Whenever possible, terms should be taken from existing TDWG standards, or vocabularies that are well-known within the Linked Data and Semantic Web communities.  
  # Focus on the practical with a goal of deployment in the *near term*.  Accomplish this by leveraging existing vocabularies and ontologies whenever possible.

Our primary deliverable will be an on-line document comprising i) use cases and competency questions covering a range of biodiversity informatics; and ii) well documented examples of using rdf/owl and sparql to address those use cases. We will deliver this to the TAG and to the broader community one year after our charter is received.

== Strategy ==

The cost of entry to our kickoff meeting at TDWG 2011 will be to present *something*, e.g. a use case, an example, a question, a proposed solution, or a stumbling block (encountered or anticipated). 
These will be written up, and will help to define the scope of a workshop to be held in early 2012. The output of the workshop will be a draft of our deliverable, which will live on-line to be edited my group members. 

== Becoming Involved ==

  * The TDWG community includes users from across the spectrum of biodiversity informatics who can share knowledge and practical experience in the application of RDF.  Anyone with an interest in applying RDF in a biodiversity context is welcome to be involved in the group.
  * Persons having practical experience creating RDF, using RDF for metadata integration, and performing reasoning tasks would be valued participants in the group.  
  * Because the focus of this group is on practical applications, metadata providers, consumers, and aggregators can make important contributions to the group, particularly through contribution of use cases and testing of models.  
  * Please contact one of the convenors to register your interest.
 
== History/Context ==

In its 2006 ‘roadmap’ (http://www.tdwg.org/uploads/media/TAG_Roadmap_01.doc) the TDWG Technical Architecture Group (TAG) described a three-pronged approach to the development of an infrastructure that would facilitate interoperability among TDWG standards and other standards outside the TDWG domain.  This approach consisted of: a Semantic Hub (a type catalog or ontology), a system of Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), and well defined data exchange protocols. 

There is broad sentiment within TDWG that we should pursue this approach via the Semantic Web/Linked Open Data. We can identify resources globally using HTTP URIs, describe the resources using RDF, and transfer information across the Internet using the HTTP protocol. The primary challenge  for implementation is arriving at a common understanding of how RDF should be used to describe biodiversity resources. 

== Summary ==
The main output of this task group will be well documented examples of using rdf and sparql to address a wide range of biodiversity informatics use cases. Our first order of business will be to collect use cases and competency questions, and to make them easily available for reference and update on a wiki. Our next order of business will be to experiment with a variety of patterns for addressing these use cases on the semantic web, noting carefully the advantages and limitations of each approach. Since semantic web usage evolves over time, our deliverable will be a living document, to be maintained either by the TAG, or by a new Semantic Web Interest Group to be spun-off after our outputs are delivered.
