= Cover page for RDF Guide proposed addition to Darwin Core =

== History ==

The [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm Darwin Core ]technical specification was adopted as a TDWG Standard in 2009.  

== What is the Darwin Core RDF Guide?==

The DwC RDF Guide will be an addition to the Darwin Core standard under the Namespace Policy (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/ ).  The Guide itself is a Type 2 document, meaning that it is a non-normative part of the standard.  It will be a parallel document to the two existing DwC Guides, the XML Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/ ) and the Text Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/ ).  In addition to the Guide document itself, this proposed addition to DwC includes the addition of a number of terms which will be added to the normative (Type 1) RDF document and to a human-readable term reference guide. 

== What are the main features of the DwC RDF Guide? == 
The guide includes an introduction which explains the need for the Guide and describes the major issues that the Guide will address.  It does not explain RDF in detail but provides a brief introduction with examples at the level of the other Guides.  The Implementation section describes the details of how Darwin Core terms should be used consistently in RDF to facilitate the development of applications that can more easily consume DwC data expressed as RDF.  The Term Reference section divides the Darwin Core terms into categories according to how they will be expected to be used.

== What are the important aspects of implementing DwC as RDF which are detailed in the Guide? ==
1. Some existing DwC terms may be used in RDF in a manner very similar to their use in text and XML.
2. The Guide introduces analogues of existing DwC terms in a new namespace dwcuri: (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/uri/) which are intended to be used exclusively with URI-referenced objects (or blank nodes).
3. The Guide recognizes that some existing text-based DwC terms cannot adequately be used in RDF and provides suggestions for alternative terms or mechanisms for expressing that information as RDF. 
4. The Guide distinguishes some DwC terms as "convenience terms" whose purpose is to make text-based searching simpler.  It introduces several properties intended for use with non-literal objects that would be used in lieu of the convenience terms to link to URI referenced (non-literal) objects that are further described using RDF. 
5. The Guide establishes the convention that terms in the Darwin Core Type vocabulary (in the namespace dwctype: = http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dwctype/ ) should be used as classes for rdf:type declarations rather than the organizational classes of the main DwC namespace (dwc: = http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/ ). 
6. The Guide describes how the imported Dublin Core terms should be used as RDF in a manner consistent with their DCMI definitions.

== What does the DwC RDF Guide NOT do? ==
The Guide does not describe a domain model. It does not define ontological relationships among Darwin Core classes.  It does not mint object properties to link the main DwC classes.
