= Cover page for RDF Guide proposed addition to Darwin Core =

== Background ==

The [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/450/ Darwin Core] [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/status-and-categories/ technical specification] was adopted as a [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/ TDWG Standard] in 2009.  The Darwin Core standard consists of a [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 1] normative document [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwctermshistory.rdf dwctermshistory.rdf] which defines its terms using [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/ Resource Description Framework (RDF)] and numerous [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 2] non-normative documents which explain the standard.  Many of these non-normative documents can be viewed on the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm Darwin Core web pages] that are part of the [http://www.tdwg.org/ TDWG website].  Among these non-normative documents are several best-practices guides (the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm Text Guide] and the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/index.htm XML Guide]) which explain how to use Darwin Core terms to transmit biodiversity data.  

The Part 3 of the Darwin Core [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/index.htm Namespace Policy document] describes how the Darwin Core Standard can be changed or extended.  This is a proposal to modify Darwin Core under the Namespace Policy and includes:
  * an [DwcRdfGuideProposal RDF Guide] that will join the other best-practices guides as non-normative documents in the standard and which will eventually be part of the Darwin Core web pages on the TDWG website.  
  * term additions and modifications necessary to implement the recommendations of the RDF Guide.  These term additions will be added to the normative RDF document and to other documents as necessary for them to function along with the rest of the Darwin Core terms.  These may be existing documents, documents that are similar to the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm quick reference guide], or documents that are used to facilitate URI dereferencing similar to [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwcterms.rdf dwcterms.rdf] and [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwctype.rdf dwctype.rdf]. These term additions and modifications will be tracked using the [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list issue tracker] on the [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/ Darwin Core Google Code site].  

== What is the Darwin Core RDF Guide?==

The DwC RDF Guide will be an addition to the Darwin Core standard under the Namespace Policy (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/ ).  The Guide itself is a Type 2 document, meaning that it is a non-normative part of the standard.  It will be a parallel document to the two existing DwC Guides, the XML Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/ ) and the Text Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/ ).  In addition to the Guide document itself, this proposed addition to DwC includes the addition of a number of terms which will be added to the normative (Type 1) RDF document and to a human-readable term reference guide. 

== What are the main features of the DwC RDF Guide? == 
The guide includes an introduction which explains the need for the Guide and describes the major issues that the Guide will address.  It does not explain RDF in detail but provides a brief introduction with examples at the level of the other Guides.  The Implementation section describes the details of how Darwin Core terms should be used consistently in RDF to facilitate the development of applications that can more easily consume DwC data expressed as RDF.  The Term Reference section divides the Darwin Core terms into categories according to how they will be expected to be used.

== What are the important aspects of implementing DwC as RDF which are detailed in the Guide? ==
1. Some existing DwC terms may be used in RDF in a manner very similar to their use in text and XML.
2. The Guide introduces analogues of existing DwC terms in a new namespace dwcuri: (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/uri/) which are intended to be used exclusively with URI-referenced objects (or blank nodes).
3. The Guide recognizes that some existing text-based DwC terms cannot adequately be used in RDF and provides suggestions for alternative terms or mechanisms for expressing that information as RDF. 
4. The Guide distinguishes some DwC terms as "convenience terms" whose purpose is to make text-based searching simpler.  It introduces several properties intended for use with non-literal objects that would be used in lieu of the convenience terms to link to URI referenced (non-literal) objects that are further described using RDF. 
5. The Guide establishes the convention that terms in the Darwin Core Type vocabulary (in the namespace dwctype: = http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dwctype/ ) should be used as classes for rdf:type declarations rather than the organizational classes of the main DwC namespace (dwc: = http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/ ). 
6. The Guide describes how the imported Dublin Core terms should be used as RDF in a manner consistent with their DCMI definitions.

== What does the DwC RDF Guide NOT do? ==
The Guide does not describe a domain model. It does not define ontological relationships among Darwin Core classes.  It does not mint object properties to link the main DwC classes.
