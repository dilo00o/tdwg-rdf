[TCSBasedTaxon RDF representation of a tc:TaxonConcept? instance and its associated reference]

This document was produced following an extended email discussion about the meaning of taxon concepts in the context of RDF.  It contains (among other things) a diagram which graphically represents a taxon concept.  It also includes examples in RDF/XML and RDF/Turtle.

[TaxonInRDF Describing Taxon Concepts as RDF]

This is an ancillary document associated with the Darwin Core RDF Guide.  The Darwin Core RDF Guide recommends against using the dwc:Taxon class terms to construct taxon concept instances (although they can be used as convenience properties).  This document provides suggestions for using terms outside of Darwin Core (i.e. the non-standard TDWG TaxonConcept and TaxonName ontology terms) to construct taxon concept or taxon name use (TNU) instances.
