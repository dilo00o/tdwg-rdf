#summary Darwin Core related competency questions.

= Introduction =

A number of Darwin Core related efforts are underway, including 
  * [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list extending Darwin Core to include new terms].
  * [CharterOfIG representing Darwin Core in RDF].
  * [http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/Biodiversity_Working_Group relating Darwin Core to genomic metadata standards].

A BoF at iEvoBio2011 [http://www.piratepad.net/iEvoBio11-BoF-reportouts discussed] the above (as well as collections-related perspectives), and amongst the agreed next steps was to establish a common repository for use cases and competency questions. Until a better home is found for the competency questions, we will collect them here. [http://marinemetadata.org/references/competencyquestionsoverview Here]'s a nice overview of what competency questions are all about.

= Competency questions =
Terms in *_bold italic_* represent the GUID that would appear in a query.

=== Darwin Core (including proposed new classes) ===
  # Find all occurrences of *_taxon_*.
    * Find all occurrences of *_taxon_* satisfying *_spatial or temporal constraint_*.
    * Find all occurrences of *_taxa of concern_*. (e.g. "Find all occurrences of endangered or invasive species.")
  # Find all occurrences for which there are no identifications.	
  # Find all occurrences for which there are multiple identifications.
  # Find all occurrences of *_individual_*.  
  # Find all identifications for *_occurrence_*.
  # Find all identifications of *_individual_*.
  # Find all evidence for *_occurrence_*.
  # Find all evidence to support the identification of *_individual_*

=== Querying biodivesity occurrences based on genomic characters ===
  # Find all occurrences of taxa whose genome includes a homolog of *_gene_*.
 

== Example and potential SPARQL queries corresponding to above ==
