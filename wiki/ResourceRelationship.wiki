==1 Introduction==
The terms in the dwc:ResourceRelationship class are designed to allow for the creation of dwc:ResourceRelationship instances having assigned identifiers.  The following example based on an example in the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/index.htm#classes XML Guide] shows how the terms may be used to describe that the specimen with catalog number 14524 is the mother of a specimen with catalog number 14523:

Table 1

term
	

dwc:resourceRelationshipID
	

dwc:resourceID
	

dwc:relatedResourceID
	

dwc:relationshipOfResource
	

dwc:relationshipEstablishedDate
	

dwc:relationshipAccordingTo

value
	

"http://guid.mvz.org/relations/23423"
	

"urn:catalog:MVZ:Mammals:14524"
	

"urn:catalog:MVZ:Mammals:14523"
	

"mother of"
	

"2001-09-14"
	

"James L Patton"

Because the ID terms cannot be used as object properties, Darwin Core does not provide a means to express this relationship as RDF.  The [www.openannotation.org/spec/core/core.html Open Annotation Data Model] should be used instead as shown in the following example which relates the same resources as in table 11.

Example 1:
{{{
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://guid.mvz.org/relations/23423">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/ResourceRelationship"/>
   <dwc:relationshipOfResource>mother of</dwc:relationshipOfResource>
  <dwc:relationshipEstablishedDate>2001-09-14</dwc:relationshipEstablishedDate>
   <dwc:relationshipAccordingTo>James L Patton</dwc:relationshipAccordingTo>
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#Annotation"/>
   <oa:hasBody rdf:resource="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MVZ:Mamm:14524"/>
   <oa:hasTarget rdf:resource="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MVZ:Mamm:14523"/>
   <oa:motivatedBy rdf:resource="http://guid.mvz.org/relationshipType/motherOf"/>
   <oa:annotatedAt>2001-09-14</oa:annotatedAt>
   <oa:annotatedBy rdf:resource="http://guid.mvz.org/agents/James_L_Patton”"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://guid.mvz.org/relations/23423">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/PhysicalObject"/>
   <rdf:type rdf:resource=http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dwctype/PreservedSpecimen"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://guid.mvz.org/relations/23424">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/PhysicalObject"/>
   <rdf:type rdf:resource=http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dwctype/PreservedSpecimen"/>
</rdf:Description>
}}}

The following points should be noted about Example 1:

- the oa:hasBody property has as its object the resource whose identifier is the value of dwc:resourceID in Table 1.

- the oa:hasTarget property has as its object the resource whose identifier is the value of dwc:relatedResourceID in Table 1.

- In accordance with Recommendation 7 of the TDWG GUID Applicability Statement, the identifiers for the two related specimens have been provided in their HTTP-proxied form.

- It might have been possible for a consuming application to determine the rdf:type of the specimen instances by dereferencing their HTTP URIs.  However, in accordance with the [http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/core.html#BodyTargetType Open Annotation recommendations], the RDF provides information about the nature of the related resources which can allow the application to determine that they are non-information resources (i.e. dcmitype:PhysicalObject) which cannot be rendered in a browser.

- Because there is a well-known object property for linking the relationship to the URI-referenced agent that noted it, oa:annotatedBy is used rather than dwcuri:relationshipAccordingTo .  Similarly, oa:motivatedBy is used rather than dwcuri:relationshipOfResource .  The value given for oa:motivatedBy should be from a controlled vocabulary which uses SKOS to relate the motivation of the annotation (i.e. the nature of the relationship) to one of the standard [http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/core.html#Motivations high level Motivation] instances such as oa:linking.
