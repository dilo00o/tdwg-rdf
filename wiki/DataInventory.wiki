#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

== Introduction ==

In response to [http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tag/2011-September/002381.html Rod Page's challenge], in follow-up to [http://piratepad.net/iEvoBio11-BoF-reportouts discussions on creating a biodiversity RDF sandbox], and in furtherance of our mission, we will load as much biodiversity data as we can into a triplestore. We'll use this page to inventory the data we probably want to include. Where possible, include links to rdf representations of the data (data dumps, sparql endpoints, etc.)

== Biodiversity RDF datasets and other semantic web infrastructure == 

  * taxonconcept.org http://www.taxonconcept.org/sparql-endpoint/ This SPARQL endpoint has 23 million triples and includes some other related databases.  I don't know if this is too many to load in the sandbox.  Perhaps some queries could be done directly on that endpoint or subsets of the data could be loaded into our sandbox to play with.  Anyway, the list on the page includes some of the datasets we should probably be looking at in addition to taxonconcept.org itself: namely the Global Name Initiative (GNI), DBpedia, geonames, etc.
  * natural solutions virtuoso triple store: so far we have put in Rod's datasets on frogs.
