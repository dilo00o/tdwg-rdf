#summary Links to data sources and SPARQL endpoints

== Introduction ==

In response to [http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tag/2011-September/002381.html Rod Page's challenge], in follow-up to [http://piratepad.net/iEvoBio11-BoF-reportouts discussions on creating a biodiversity RDF sandbox], and in furtherance of our mission, we will load as much biodiversity data as we can into a triplestore. We'll use this page to inventory the data we probably want to include. Where possible, include links to rdf representations of the data (data dumps, sparql endpoints, etc.)

== Biodiversity RDF datasets and other semantic web infrastructure == 

  * taxonconcept.org http://www.taxonconcept.org/sparql-endpoint/ This SPARQL endpoint has 23 million triples and includes some other related databases. Queries can be done directly on that endpoint at http://lsd.taxonconcept.org/sparql for a generic web interface and at http://lsd.taxonconcept.org/isparql for a human-friendly interface.  Datasets include the Global Name Index (GNI), DBpedia, geonames, etc. in addition to Pete's taxonconcept.org database.  The Bioimages images and IndividualOrganism datasets are also loaded into the triplestore, so queries based on Darwin-SW can also be tested here.
  * Natural Solutions virtuoso triple store: so far we have put in Rod's datasets on frogs.http://82.96.149.133:8890/sparql
Feel Free to play with the sparql interface.
