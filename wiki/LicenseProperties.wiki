== 1 Introduction ==

The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) vocabulary (defined at http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) describes the core relationships among property rights terms.  The property {{{dcterms:rights}}} is defined as "information about rights held in and over the resource". These rights can include rights of access (described using the subproperty {{{dcterms:accessRights}}}) and intellectual property rights such as copyright.  An important subproperty of {{{dcterms:rights}}} is {{{dcterms:license}}}, defined as "a legal document giving official permission to do something with the resource".

The Creative Commons organization (http://creativecommons.org/) has standardized a set of licenses which allow creators of intellectual property to retain copyright of their works while allowing certain types of use without requiring permission from the copyright owner.  These licenses are widely used on the Internet and have become the de-facto standard for specifying how works can be reused by others.  Each license is identified by a URI which can be the object of an RDF triple.

== 2 License properties ==

In addition to {{{dcterms:license}}}, there are three well-known properties that can be used as predicates in RDF triples describing license properties of a resource.

=== 2.1 xmpRights:!UsageTerms ==

Audubon Core (supply permanent URL here) specifies that {{{xmpRights:UsageTerms}}} should be used to describe "the license statement defining how resources may be used" and provides an example of a string description of a Creative Commons license.  The {{{xmpRights:}}} namespace terms are defined in a PDF document rather than as RDF, so following the example of Audubon Core and expressing the value of {{{xmpRights:UsageTerms}}} as a literal object in an RDF triple would not introduce any inconsistencies.

RDF/XML:
{{{
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/baskauf/87943">
     <xmpRights:UsageTerms xml:lang="en">Available under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 license</xmpRights:UsageTerms>
</rdf:Description>
}}}

Turtle:
{{{
<http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/baskauf/87943>
     xmpRights:UsageTerms "Available under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 license"@en.
}}}

=== 2.2 xhv:license ===

Creative Commons provides guidelines for expressing license information on the Semantic Web in the form of RDFa (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa).  The following snippet of XHTML contains RDF in the form of RDFa:

{{{
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"><img alt="fruit of Hedyotis crassifolia" style="border-width:0" src="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/gq/baskauf/g87943.jpg" /></a>
}}}

Using the rel="license" attribute of an anchor tag in RDFa asserts an {{{xhv:license}}} property (in addition to establishing a generic HTML Link Relation; see http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml).  A client capable of consuming RDFa would infer the same triple as in these examples:

RDF/XML:
{{{
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/gq/baskauf/g87943.jpg">
     <xhv:license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"/>
</rdf:Description>
}}}

Turtle:
{{{
<http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/gq/baskauf/g87943.jpg>
     xhv:license <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/>.
}}}

The term is itself defined in RDFa at 


=== 2.3 cc:license ===
