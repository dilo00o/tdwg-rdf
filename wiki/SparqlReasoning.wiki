#summary Example of inferring inverse relationships.

= Scenario =
In this scenario, we model two inverse relationships: hasParent and hasChild.  The following namespaces are used, although they could really be anything:
{{{
PREFIX local: <http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/rdf/local#>
PREFIX ns: <http://fake.org/>
}}}
The relationships can be represented graphically like this:

The two relationships are declared to be inversely related using the {{{owl:inverseOf}}} property.  Normally, only one of the {{{owl:inverseOf}}} declarations would be required since the second could be inferred from the first.  But to simplify the query, both have been asserted explicitly.

The following graph will be used in the example:
