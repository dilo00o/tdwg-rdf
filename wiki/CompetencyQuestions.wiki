#summary Darwin Core related competency questions.

= Introduction =

A number of Darwin Core related efforts are underway, including 
  * [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list extending Darwin Core to include new terms].
  * [CharterOfIG representing Darwin Core in RDF].
  * harmonizing Darwin Core with genomic metadata standards.

Until a better home is found for competency questions for the above efforts, we will collect them here.
