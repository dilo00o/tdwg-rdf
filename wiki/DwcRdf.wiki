= Cover page for RDF Guide proposed addition to Darwin Core =

== Background ==

The [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/450/ Darwin Core] [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/status-and-categories/ technical specification] was adopted as a [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/ TDWG Standard] in 2009.  The Darwin Core standard consists of a [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 1] normative document ([http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwctermshistory.rdf dwctermshistory.rdf]) which defines its terms using [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/ Resource Description Framework (RDF)], and numerous [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 2] non-normative documents which explain the standard.  Many of these non-normative standards documents can be viewed on the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm Darwin Core web pages] that are part of the [http://www.tdwg.org/ TDWG website].  Among these non-normative documents are several best-practices guides (the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm Text Guide] and the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/index.htm XML Guide]) which explain how to use Darwin Core terms to transmit biodiversity data.  

Part 3 of the Darwin Core [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/index.htm Namespace Policy document] describes how the Darwin Core Standard can be changed or extended.  This is the cover page of a proposal to modify Darwin Core under the Namespace Policy and includes:
  * an [DwcRdfGuideProposal RDF Guide] that will join the other best-practices guides as non-normative (Type 2) documents in the standard and which will eventually be part of the Darwin Core web pages on the TDWG website.  
  * term additions and modifications necessary to implement the recommendations of the RDF Guide.  These term additions will be added to the normative (Type 1) RDF document and to other documents as necessary for them to function along with the rest of the Darwin Core terms.  These documents may already exist, or documents may be created that are similar to the [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm quick reference guide] and the documents that are used to facilitate URI dereferencing (such as [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwcterms.rdf dwcterms.rdf] and [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/source/browse/trunk/rdf/dwctype.rdf dwctype.rdf]). These term additions and modifications will be tracked using the [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list issue tracker] on the [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/ Darwin Core Google Code site].  

Linked to this proposal are several [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 3] documents which will not become part of the standard, but which provide [http://code.google.com/p/tdwg-rdf/wiki/DwCAncillary ancillary information] to support the guide and to provide examples that include terms outside of Darwin Core.  

== Why is a Darwin Core RDF Guide needed? ==

Since Darwin Core terms can currently be dereferenced as RDF, it would seem like a simple matter to adopt the Darwin Core vocabulary for use in RDF.  However, because Darwin Core is a general-purpose vocabulary, many of its terms are defined to facilitate their use in relatively "flat", text-based databases.  In contrast, RDF is by its nature very normalized and often uses URI references in place of text literals.  Therefore, there is a need to unambiguously distinguish between terms whose values should be text literals and those whose values should be URI references.  There is also a need for clarity in how a variety of kinds of identifiers should be referenced in RDF.  It is also unclear at the present how classes defined as Darwin Core terms should be used as part of type declarations in RDF.  The RDF Guide addresses each of these issues.  

== What are the main features of the DwC RDF Guide? == 
The guide includes an introduction which explains the need for the Guide and describes the major issues that the Guide will address.  It does not explain RDF in detail but provides a brief introduction with examples at the level of the other Guides.  The Implementation section describes the details of how Darwin Core terms should be used consistently in RDF to facilitate the development of applications that can more easily consume DwC data expressed as RDF.  The Term Reference section divides the Darwin Core terms into categories according to how they will be expected to be used.

== What are the important aspects of implementing DwC as RDF which are detailed in the Guide? ==

1. Some existing DwC terms may be used in RDF in a manner very similar to their use in text and XML.

2. The Guide introduces analogues of existing DwC terms in a new namespace _dwcuri:_ ({{{http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/uri/}}}) that are intended to be used exclusively with URI-referenced objects (or blank nodes).

3. The Guide distinguishes some DwC terms as "convenience terms" whose purpose is to make text-based searching simpler.  It introduces several properties intended for use with non-literal objects that would be used in lieu of the convenience terms to link to URI referenced (non-literal) objects that are further described using RDF. 

4. The Guide recognizes that some existing text-based DwC terms cannot adequately be used in RDF and provides references to suggestions for alternative terms or mechanisms for expressing that information as RDF. These suggestions are included in informational [http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/pages/tdwg-stds-spec.pdf Type 3] [[http://code.google.com/p/tdwg-rdf/wiki/DwCAncillary web pages] which will not become part of the standard itself nor be included in the Darwin Core web pages on the TDWG website.  [http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/wiki/DarwinCoreTerms Similar pages] already exist on the Darwin Core Google Code site.  

5. The Guide establishes the convention that terms in the Darwin Core Type vocabulary (in the namespace _dwctype:_ = {{{http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dwctype/}}}) should be used as classes for _rdf:type_ declarations rather than the organizational classes of the main DwC namespace (_dwc:_ = {{{http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/}}}). 

6. The Guide describes how the imported Dublin Core terms should be used as RDF in a manner consistent with their DCMI definitions.

== What does the DwC RDF Guide NOT do? ==
The Guide does not describe a domain model. It does not define ontological relationships among Darwin Core classes.  It does not mint object properties to link the main DwC classes. 

== What process has/will occur in the ratification of this proposal? ==

Informal discussions on the [http://code.google.com/p/tdwg-rdf/ TDWG RDF/OWL Task Group]'s [http://groups.google.com/group/tdwg-rdf email list] and at several meetings resulted in sufficient consensus to begin work on an RDF guide.  Members of the RDF and Darwin Core Task Groups volunteered to write a draft document.  Following a 30 day comment period during which the other task group members were invited to read and comment on the draft, the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLyVFuveGX1a0Yt6Niok9FfGxkrghii-xlGYhwO8UqE/edit?usp=sharing document was revised].  The RDF Task Group then recommended that the draft move forward to official submission as an addition to Darwin Core according to the provisions of the Darwin Core Namespace Policy.  The documents linked to this cover page are available for review by the public during the required 30 day public comment period.  Following public comment, the proposal will be modified as necessary and submitted for official ratification to become part of the Darwin Core standard.
